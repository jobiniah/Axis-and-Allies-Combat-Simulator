# Axis and Allies Combat Simulator

This python script enters at main.py and enquires about the units involved in combat.  Following this input, a monte carlo simulation is run for 10,000 iterations to display the range/frequency of combats one might face in that given situation.

| Unit     | Unit ID |
|----------|---------|
| Infantry | 1       |
| Armor    | 2       |
| Fighter  | 3       |
| Bomber   | 4       |
| Anti Aircraft| 5   |
| Battleship | 6     |
| Aircraft Carrier | 7 |
| Transport | 8      |
| Submarine | 9      |

## Note:
Output graph values favour attackers in the positive domain and defenders in the negative domain.
